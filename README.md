# Blog.UnknownRori

This project is just one of my project to create a blog site with built in CMS to share my thought since I always
write in Vue so this time I will do it in React.

## Development

Make sure you have supabase project ready and nodejs (for db setup is later)

```sh
# Clone and enter to cloned directory
git clone https://github.com/UnknownRori/blog.unknownrori
cd blog.unknownrori

# Install package and run it on localhost
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
